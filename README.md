# Daily-Coding-Problem-05

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

# Context

So what is car and cdr anyway?
A cons cell is composed of two pointers; the car operation extracts the first pointer, and the cdr operation extracts the second.
